### Data modelling and ETL using Cassandra
This repo. contains the code to implement a ETL pipeline using Cassandra database. It mimics a fictious scenario setout in the UDacity Data Engineering with AWS Nanodegree. 

### Project Background: Data Modeling with Cassandra
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app. They'd like to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. As a result, in this project, the Sparkify event and song data are modeled with Apache Cassandra with an ETL pipeline using Python.
